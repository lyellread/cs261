As the wind does blow

Across the trees I see the

Buds blooming in May          



I walk across sand

And find myself blistering

In the hot hot heat



Falling to the ground

I watch a leaf settle down

In a bed of brown.



It's cold and I wait

For someone to shelter me

And take me from here.



I hear crackling

Crunch of today's new found day

And know it won't last



So I will leave it

At bay; and hope for the best

This bitter new day
